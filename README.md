## Introduction

WFB-ng client (Video Decoder) for Rockchip platform powered by the [Rockchip MPP library](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/mpp).
It also displays a simple cairo based OSD that shows the bandwidth, decoding latency, and framerate of the decoded video, and wfb-ng link statistics.

This project is based on a unique frozen development [FPVue_rk](https://github.com/gehee/FPVue_rk) by [Gee He](https://github.com/gehee).

Tested on RK3566 (Radxa Zero 3W) and RK3588s (Orange Pi 5).
